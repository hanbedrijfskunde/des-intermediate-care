Project Logistics for Healthy Healthcare

**Problem Outline/Background**

To ensure the long-term viability of the Dutch healthcare system, it is increasingly important to gain control over regional healthcare frameworks. In particular, understanding the capacity of nursing homes, the number of first-line stay (FLV) and crisis beds, as well as the corresponding waiting times and occupancy rates, is essential. A first-line stay (FLV) refers to a short-term residency in a care institution for individuals who are temporarily unable to live independently at home due to medical reasons. Crisis beds are designated for individuals who require immediate (i.e., urgent) care. Gaining regional insight into these types of capacities and the performance of the healthcare logistics system can significantly contribute to improving overall care delivery.

Within the _Logistics for Healthy Healthcare_ project, we are employing mathematical modeling to identify ways to optimize the utilization of available nursing home, FLV, and crisis beds. Currently, this information is either absent or not readily accessible. Our goal is to collect this data for the Arnhem (and Nijmegen) region in the most efficient manner possible (preferably via online databases) and translate it into a dynamic digital dashboard.

**Assignment**

Develop a dynamic digital dashboard for the Arnhem (and Nijmegen) region (at the municipal level) that provides insights into the available number of nursing home beds, the number of first-line stay (FLV) and crisis beds, as well as the corresponding waiting times and occupancy rates.
