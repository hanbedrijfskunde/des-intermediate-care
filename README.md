# Discrete Event Simulation for Intermediate Care (Arnhem & Nijmegen Region)

## Introduction and Objectives

Intermediate care – known in Dutch as **Eerstelijns Verblijf (ELV)** – provides short-term nursing home beds for patients who do not require hospital admission but cannot be safely treated at home ([Thesis_Casper_van_Loon_Final](docs/loon.pdf)). In practice, inadequate access to these beds has led to prolonged hospital stays and costly delays in care ([Arntzen et al. 2023](docs/Arntzen%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Avoiding%20Hospital%20Admissions%20and%20Delayed%20Transfers%20of%20Care%20by%20Improved%20Access%20to%20Intermediate%20Care.pdf)). In regions such as Arnhem and Nijmegen, older patients face significant waiting times (median ~1.8 days) for intermediate care placements, resulting in avoidable hospital admissions ([Arntzen et al. 2023f](docs/Arntzen%20et%20al.%20-%202023%20-%20Avoiding%20Hospital%20Admissions%20and%20Delayed%20Transfers%20of%20Care%20by%20Improved%20Access%20to%20Intermediate%20Care.pdf)). To address these bottlenecks, we develop a **discrete event simulation (DES)** model that evaluates bed availability and patient flow for nursing home convalescence beds, primary care stays (ELV), and crisis beds in the Arnhem/Nijmegen region. The goal is to test policy improvements and provide insights to **optimize intermediate care** by reducing waiting times and improving access.

## Simulation Model Design

Our DES model represents the day-to-day operations of intermediate care facilities in the region. It simulates the journey of each patient from arrival (referral or hospital discharge) through triage and admission into an available bed, until discharge from the intermediate care. Key components and assumptions of the model include:

- **Patient Arrivals (Demand):** We assume **Poisson-distributed patient arrivals**, a common and validated approach for modeling random healthcare demand ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=be%20used%20best%20for%20modeling,15%20All)). Separate Poisson streams can represent different sources (e.g. hospital referrals, GP referrals for ELV, and emergency/crisis cases). The model can incorporate time-dependent arrival rates to reflect demand surges – for example, higher arrivals during daytime or weekday peaks ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=process%20is%20modeled%20as%20a,as%20exponential%20or%20gamma%20distributions)). These surges capture the fluctuating demand that leads to periods of strain on bed availability.

- **Bed Capacity and Types:** The region’s intermediate care beds are categorized into regular nursing/ELV beds and a small number of **crisis beds** reserved for urgent cases. We initialize the model with the current number of beds in each category (based on Arnhem/Nijmegen data or estimates). Bed availability fluctuates as patients occupy and vacate beds over time. At baseline, capacity is tight – intermediate care units often operate at ~85% occupancy on average ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=quite%20similar%20to%20the%20real,mean%20than%20the%20simulated%20data)) – meaning even modest demand spikes can fill all beds. The simulation tracks bed occupancy and any queue of waiting patients when demand temporarily exceeds supply.

- **Triage and Transfer Process:** When a patient is referred to intermediate care, an **admission/triage process** takes place before the patient actually transfers into a bed. In current practice, this involves administrative steps and finding a suitable placement, which introduces a delay (transfer time). We model this **triage delay** as an additional waiting time for the patient prior to bed admission. Based on expert input from similar cases, we use an average transfer delay of around 1.5 days in the baseline scenario ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20because%20of%20staff%20shortages%2C,5%20days)). This reflects the observed inefficiencies in processing referrals and coordinating handovers. During this period, a patient may effectively hold a spot in queue (or even stay in hospital if coming from an acute setting). If a bed is free but triage isn’t completed, the bed might appear “available” but cannot be filled until the process finishes. This component is crucial, as **inefficient triage contributes significantly to overall waiting times** ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=becomes%20clear%20that%20the%20patients,explore%20in%20the%20next%20step)).

- **Daily Operations and Events:** The DES model moves through time, logging events such as patient arrivals, admissions, and discharges. We simulate at the granularity of hours, but summarize outputs per day for reporting. Each day:
  - New patient arrivals occur (randomly via the Poisson process).
  - If a patient arrives and a suitable bed is _immediately available_ **and** the facility is accepting admissions at that time, the patient begins the transfer/triage process or is admitted straight away if triage is instantaneous. Otherwise, the patient joins a waiting list.
  - Triage completion events: after the simulated triage delay, waiting patients can be assigned to the next available bed.
  - Discharges: Patients currently in intermediate care complete their stay based on a **length-of-stay (LOS)** distribution (modeled as exponential or gamma, reflecting observed stay lengths ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=be%20used%20best%20for%20modeling,15%20All))). When a patient is discharged, that bed becomes free for the next waiting patient (if any).
  - The model accounts for day/night and weekday/weekend differences. For example, in the baseline, admissions may be restricted at night or on weekends due to limited staffing (any arrivals during off-hours would have to wait until the next morning or Monday). These operational rules are captured in the simulation schedule.

By simulating many days (e.g. over several months or a year with multiple replications), we obtain statistically reliable performance metrics. The model is calibrated to current conditions so that baseline results (occupancy, average waits, etc.) align with known data or estimates for the Arnhem and Nijmegen region.

## Policy Scenarios Tested

We use the DES model to experiment with several **policy scenarios** and compare them to the status quo. Each scenario modifies the model’s parameters or logic to reflect a proposed improvement in intermediate care operations:

- **1. 24/7 Admissions:** In this scenario, intermediate care facilities accept admissions around the clock, including evenings and weekends. We remove the constraint that prevented admissions outside of normal working hours. Concretely, patients can be transferred to a bed as soon as one is free and triage is done, even at 2 AM or on a Sunday. This policy prevents the build-up of a weekend backlog and avoids situations where patients wait idle simply because the intake office is closed. A similar approach was studied as an “admission turns” system where facilities take evening/night admission duty by rotation, effectively enabling 24/7 access with minimal delays ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Admission%20turns%20The%20proposed%20alternative,to%20compensate%20STRC%20locations%20for)). We expect this change to **significantly reduce waiting times**, especially for patients whose referrals currently arrive late in the day or on Fridays. By eliminating off-hour delays, the flow of patients becomes smoother. Prior research indicates that enabling evening/weekend admissions can sharply cut wait times and prevent unnecessary hospital days ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=are%20not%20a%20result%20of,for%20intermediate%20care%20that%20can)). Our simulation will show if freeing up admissions timing leads to higher bed utilization (by filling beds faster) without overwhelming the system.

- **2. Improved Triage Efficiency:** This scenario streamlines the admission process to **reduce transfer times**. We simulate a more efficient triage system – for example, dedicating staff to quickly process referrals or implementing a centralized placement system – such that the administrative delay is shortened (e.g. from ~1.5 days to a few hours). In the model, we might reduce the average triage delay to, say, 4 hours (as in the cited admission-turns scenario ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Admission%20turns%20The%20proposed%20alternative,to%20compensate%20STRC%20locations%20for))) or even approach zero delay in an ideal case. The impact of this is that patients move into available beds faster, freeing up hospital resources and improving flow. We anticipate a substantial drop in waiting time as this was identified as a key bottleneck. Indeed, a sensitivity analysis in Amsterdam showed that the prevailing ~1.8-day wait was largely caused by the triage/transfer lag and could be almost eliminated by speeding up admissions ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20that%2C%20most,explore%20in%20the%20next%20step)) ([Thesis_Casper_van_Loon_Final (1).pdf](file://file-LZPDJZ38oSY3n6MVd9PjMx#:~:text=waiting%20times%20can%20be%20reduced,waiting%20time%20is%20almost%20zero)). Our DES results should reflect that **faster triage leads to shorter queues** and fewer patients held up in hospital. It may also slightly increase overall throughput (more admissions processed in a given time) if beds were occasionally left idle waiting for paperwork in the baseline. We will observe metrics like the average transfer delay and how many patients are waiting at any time under this improved process.

- **3. Additional Bed Capacity:** This scenario tests the effect of increasing the number of intermediate care beds available. We simulate an expansion of capacity (for example, adding a certain number of ELV beds or opening a new wing). Intuitively, more beds should accommodate more patients and reduce competition for space. This is especially helpful during **demand surges** – sudden influxes of patients can be absorbed if spare beds are available, rather than causing a queue. The model will allow us to adjust total bed count and examine resulting occupancy and wait times. However, it is important to note that simply adding beds may have **diminishing returns** if the core delays are elsewhere. If, for instance, triage is very slow or admissions are limited by scheduling, extra beds could sit empty waiting for administrative processes to catch up. A prior case study found that increasing beds beyond the current level did not significantly reduce waiting time when triage and off-hour closures were the real bottleneck ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20that%2C%20most,explore%20in%20the%20next%20step)). Therefore, our simulation will highlight whether the Arnhem/Nijmegen region is truly capacity-constrained or if operational efficiencies yield more benefit. We will run scenarios with, say, +10% and +20% bed capacity and observe the changes in occupancy rate and queue lengths.

We can also combine these interventions (for example, implementing both 24/7 admissions and improved triage together) to see **synergistic effects**. In fact, combining process improvements has the potential to nearly eliminate waits – one study showed that opening intermediate care 24/7 _and_ expediting transfers brought the average waiting time to virtually zero ([Thesis_Casper_van_Loon_Final (1).pdf](file://file-LZPDJZ38oSY3n6MVd9PjMx#:~:text=waiting%20times%20can%20be%20reduced,waiting%20time%20is%20almost%20zero)). Our scenario analysis will compare the status quo against each policy (and combinations, if relevant) to identify which changes yield the largest improvements in access and flow.

## Simulation Outputs and Dashboard

After running the simulation for each scenario, we collect key **performance metrics** to evaluate intermediate care availability and responsiveness. These metrics are presented through a visual dashboard and accompanying statistical reports for clarity. The dashboard would likely include charts and tables for the following indicators:

- **Bed Availability & Occupancy:** We track the number of beds occupied vs. free each day. The dashboard can show the average **occupancy rate** (percentage of beds in use) as well as trends over time (peaks and troughs in bed usage). High occupancy (e.g. consistently >85% ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=quite%20similar%20to%20the%20real,mean%20than%20the%20simulated%20data))) indicates strain on the system. The simulation output might highlight how often the system is at full capacity and for how long. For each scenario, we compare occupancy levels – for instance, additional bed capacity might lower the average occupancy, whereas 24/7 admissions might keep beds from sitting idle overnight, slightly increasing average occupancy but reducing waiting.

- **Waiting Times for Admission:** This is a critical metric representing how long patients wait from the time they are ready for intermediate care (e.g. hospital discharge or GP referral) until they are actually admitted to a bed. We report the average waiting time and distribution (e.g. median and percent of patients waiting more than 1 day, etc.) for each scenario. The dashboard could show a **comparison of waiting times** in a bar chart for baseline vs. each policy scenario. We expect to see markedly lower waiting times under the 24/7 admission and improved triage scenarios. For example, in the efficient triage + extended hours scenario, the model may show wait times dropping to only a few hours, whereas the baseline might be over a day ([Thesis_Casper_van_Loon_Final (1).pdf](file://file-LZPDJZ38oSY3n6MVd9PjMx#:~:text=waiting%20times%20can%20be%20reduced,waiting%20time%20is%20almost%20zero)). Shorter waits mean fewer delayed transfers of care, which translates to fewer unnecessary hospital bed days.

- **Throughput and Admissions:** The reports will include the total number of patients admitted per day or week. This reflects how well the system is handling demand. If a scenario enables more admissions (by reducing downtime or freeing capacity), we will see an increase in throughput. For instance, allowing weekend admissions adds two extra days of intake, so weekly admissions could increase accordingly. We also monitor if any patients **could not be admitted** (or had to be diverted) due to lack of beds – a crucial indicator of system capacity shortfall. Ideally, with sufficient beds or better processes, denied admissions should approach zero.

- **Crisis vs Routine Admissions:** Since our model includes crisis beds, we can generate stats specific to urgent cases. The dashboard might show the average wait for crisis cases (which should be minimal by design) and how often a crisis patient finds no immediate bed. This helps ensure that emergency needs are met. Similarly, we can report separate occupancy for crisis-designated beds versus regular ELV beds, if applicable.

- **Comparative Scenario Impact:** A special section of the dashboard or report will summarize **the impact of each policy scenario** side by side. For example, a table might list each scenario (24/7 admissions, Improved Triage, Added Beds, and perhaps combinations) and key outcomes: average wait time, occupancy rate, percentage of days with full occupancy, etc. This makes it easy to identify which intervention yields the best improvement. We expect to see that process-oriented interventions (triage and 24/7 access) have a dramatic effect on waiting time and slightly improved throughput, whereas adding beds might show moderate reductions in wait time unless demand was extremely high. Such comparative visuals and statistics provide evidence for decision-makers on which changes would most improve intermediate care performance ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=intermediate%20care%20that%20can%20serve,best%20ways%20to%20solve%20them)).

The dashboard would be interactive and visual, but since we cannot render charts here, one can imagine line graphs of occupancy over time, bar charts of average wait by scenario, and perhaps distribution plots of wait times. All these outputs together give a comprehensive view of the system’s behavior under each policy.

## Insights and Recommendations

By analyzing the simulation results, we gain valuable insights into how to **optimize intermediate care in the Arnhem and Nijmegen region**. The DES model highlights where the true bottlenecks lie: whether in capacity or in operational processes. In similar case studies, it was found that long waits were **not always due to insufficient beds, but rather due to inefficiencies in admissions and triage** ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=Figure%201%20shows%20that%2C%20most,explore%20in%20the%20next%20step)). Our scenario tests will likely reflect the same pattern. Key findings and recommendations might include:

- **Triage Efficiency is Critical:** Streamlining the referral and triage process can yield significant reductions in waiting time and improve patient flow. The simulation shows that even without adding new beds, addressing the administrative delays (for example, by introducing a faster triage protocol or a dedicated intake team) can utilize existing capacity more effectively. This aligns with evidence that an inefficient application process was the main cause of delays in intermediate care access ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=are%20not%20a%20result%20of,for%20intermediate%20care%20that%20can)). We recommend prioritizing investments in a more efficient triage system (e.g. centralized intake software, better coordination between hospitals and nursing homes) as a first step to cut down wait times.

- **Extend Admission Hours:** Enabling **24/7 admissions** (or at least evening and weekend intake) keeps the intermediate care pipeline flowing continuously. The DES scenario demonstrates that when admissions are not restricted to office hours, patients no longer accumulate in queues over the weekend, and beds that free up on a Friday night can be filled by Saturday instead of remaining empty till Monday. This policy can drastically reduce the average wait and virtually eliminate the weekend effect. Regions that piloted round-the-clock admission coverage saw waiting times drop to near zero ([Thesis_Casper_van_Loon_Final (1).pdf](file://file-LZPDJZ38oSY3n6MVd9PjMx#:~:text=waiting%20times%20can%20be%20reduced,waiting%20time%20is%20almost%20zero)), indicating that this measure can effectively solve delays when coupled with efficient triage. Therefore, we recommend implementing an on-call admission rotation or staffing plan to allow admissions at any time, ensuring no avoidable delay for patients ready to transfer.

- **Adequate (but Not Excessive) Bed Capacity:** While adding beds alone is not a silver bullet, it can provide a buffer during peak demand. The simulation results will show how much waiting time improves with additional capacity. If the baseline model exhibits frequent periods where all beds are occupied and a queue forms, that signals a need for capacity expansion in the region. On the other hand, if waits drop mainly through process improvements, it underlines that existing capacity was underutilized due to logistic issues. Our model can identify the **optimal number of beds** needed to meet demand without excessive idle capacity. For example, if raising capacity by 20% yields no waiting at all, one might choose a smaller increase that balances cost vs. benefit (since extremely low occupancy is inefficient). Decision-makers can use these insights to plan investments in new beds or redistribution of beds across facilities in Arnhem and Nijmegen.

- **Impact on Hospitals:** A crucial outcome of optimizing intermediate care is the reduction of **delayed transfers of care** from hospitals. When intermediate care beds are accessible quickly, hospital patients can be discharged promptly to the appropriate facility, freeing hospital beds for acute patients. Our DES model indirectly captures this by noting that shorter waits mean fewer patients staying extra days in hospital. In scenario analyses with 24/7 admission and fast triage, we expect the number of patients experiencing a delay >1 day to drop significantly, thereby decreasing “bed-blocking” in hospitals. This has cost benefits and improves patient outcomes (since prolonged hospital stays can lead to complications ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=outcomes%2C%20such%20as%20infections%2C%20delirium%2C,1e3))). The simulation thus provides evidence for broader system benefits: improved intermediate care availability helps the entire healthcare continuum.

In summary, the DES model serves as a **decision-support tool** for intermediate care planning in the Arnhem and Nijmegen region. It allows stakeholders to virtually test policy changes – such as around-the-clock admissions, streamlined triage, or capacity increases – and see the projected effects on bed availability, occupancy, and waiting times. The results underscore that focusing on **operational efficiency (triage and admission logistics)** can unlock existing capacity and greatly reduce waits ([1-s2.0-S1525861023004176-main.pdf](file://file-HR7Gr5zeJVUaNim7qV3srM#:~:text=intermediate%20care%20that%20can%20serve,best%20ways%20to%20solve%20them)), while strategic increases in capacity can further ensure that surges in demand are handled without delays. By implementing the insights from this simulation, healthcare providers and administrators can optimize the intermediate care system, minimizing unnecessary hospital stays and ensuring that elderly patients receive timely, appropriate care on their road to recovery.
